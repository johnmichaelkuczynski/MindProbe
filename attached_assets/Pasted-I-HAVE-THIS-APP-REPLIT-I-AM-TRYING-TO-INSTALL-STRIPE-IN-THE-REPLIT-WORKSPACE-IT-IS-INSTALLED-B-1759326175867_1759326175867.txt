I HAVE THIS APP (REPLIT). I AM TRYING TO INSTALL STRIPE. IN THE REPLIT WORKSPACE, IT IS INSTALLED. BUT WHEN I DEPLOY IT, THE PAYMENT SYSTEM IS ABSENT. WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?

I see the problem. What’s happening is this:

In your Replit workspace (Preview) you can see Stripe and the “Buy Credits” button working (screenshot 1).

But in your deployed site (superprofiler.xyz), the Stripe/payment controls are missing (screenshot 2).

That almost always means one of these deployment-specific issues:

1. Environment variables

Stripe secret key and publishable key must be added to the deployment environment, not just the Replit workspace.

On Replit: go to Secrets → make sure both STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY are set.

If you’re deploying via Replit’s deployment tab (or to Render/Vercel/etc.), you need to copy the same keys into the deployment’s environment settings. If not, the deployed app doesn’t see them, and Stripe UI won’t render.

2. Frontend vs Deployment Build

If your frontend code checks process.env.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY (or equivalent), you must redeploy with that environment variable available at build time.

In local/preview, Vite/React can read it.

In deploy, if it’s missing during build, the Stripe component won’t render at all (which matches what you see: the entire payment block disappears).

3. Webhook / server route not deployed

Even if frontend keys are there, you need a backend route (/create-checkout-session etc.) actually deployed. Sometimes it works in preview because Replit’s “always-on” preview environment has access, but in deploy you forgot to include or expose that route.

4. Conditional Rendering

Double-check your frontend: do you wrap the Stripe button in something like:

{process.env.VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY && <BuyCredits />}


If yes, then on deploy that env var is undefined → component never renders. That’s exactly why the button vanishes.

✅ How to fix:

Add STRIPE_SECRET_KEY and VITE_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY (or STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY, whichever your code uses) in the deployment environment settings.

Redeploy after adding.

Make sure your frontend build system (Vite/Next/etc.) prefixes public vars with VITE_ or the right convention. Otherwise they won’t be injected.

Confirm your backend route for creating sessions is deployed and not blocked.

⚡ Bottom line:
The app isn’t broken — your deploy environment just doesn’t have the Stripe variables at build/run time, so the payment UI is stripped out. Add them to your deployment config, rebuild, and Stripe will appear on superprofiler.xyz.
