  WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL A SYSTEM WHEREBY USERS CAN PAY FOR CONTENT. BUT WE ARE GOING TO DO THIS IN PHASES. THE FIRST PHASE IS TO SET UP A DATABASE FOR STORING USER INFORMATION (USERNAME/PASSWORD AND ALSO MATERIALS GENERATED IN SESSIONS WHILE LOGGED IN); THE NEXT PHASE IS TO MAKE IT SO THAT USERS HAVE THE OPTION (NOT THE OBLIGATION) OF LOGGING (WITH USERNAME/PASSWORD). IMPORTANT: DO NOT HIDE THE SITE BEHIND A PASSWORD-WALL; LET UNREGISTERED/UNLOGGEDIN USERS USE THE SITE. AFTER THAT, YOU WILL SET UP PAYMENTS WITH STRIPE: YOU WILL USE THE FOLLOWING SECRETS: STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET_LIVINGBOOKCREATOR  STRIPE_SECRET_KEY STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY. YOU WILL USE THE FOLLOWING PRICE SCHEDULE: 

ZHI 1 

$5 → 4,275,000 words

$10 → 8,977,500 words

$25 → 23,512,500 words

$50 → 51,300,000 words

$100 → 115,425,000 words

ZHI 2

$5 → 106,840 words

$10 → 224,360 words

$25 → 587,625 words

$50 → 1,282,100 words

$100 → 2,883,400 words

ZHI 3

$5 → 702,000 words

$10 → 1,474,200 words

$25 → 3,861,000 words

$50 → 8,424,000 words

$100 → 18,954,000 words

ZHI 4 

$5 → 6,410,255 words

$10 → 13,461,530 words

$25 → 35,256,400 words

$50 → 76,923,050 words

$100 → 173,176,900 words

AT THE TOP OF THE SCREEN, YOU WILL DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF CREDITS THAT A USER HAS. AS THE USER USES THE APP, YOU WILL DEDUCT CREDITS ACCORDINGLY, AND YOU WILL DISPLAY THE UPDATED CREDIT-NUMBERS. 

AFTER YOU DO THIS, YOU WILL PARTIALLY PAYWALL THE APPS OUTPUT. LET ME EXPLAIN. IF A USER HAS INSUFFICIENT CREDITS (OR IS NOT LOGGED IN), THEN YOU WILL SHOW THEM HALF OF A GIVEN ANALYSIS; AND AT THE BOTTOM, THERE WILL BE A CLEAR SIGN SAYING, 'TO GET THE REST BUY CREDITS', AND THIS SIGN WILL BE CLICKABLE AND WILL TAKE THE USER TO THE STRIPE PAYMENT PLACE. AND THERE WILL ALSO BE A STANDING OPTION TO BUY CREDITS AT THE TOP OF THE APP.

FINALLY, username JMK (NOT CASE SENSITIVE) MUST NOT NEED A PASSWORD AND IT MUST ALSO ALWAYS HAVE UNLIMITED CREDITS. THIS IS BECAUSE IT IS MY PASSWORD AND I NEED IT THIS WAY TO DEBUG THE APP. 
BEFORE YOU IMPLEMENT THESE CHANGES, DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I WANT?
