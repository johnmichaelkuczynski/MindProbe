ntroduction
I will show that McTaggart's famous "proof" of the unreality of time is a failure. The reason: It falsely assumes that temporal relations must themselves be changeable if there are to be such relations. The argument I give here shows that McTaggart's reasoning collapses—and not for any reasons involving an "indexical fallacy," which is a total straw man.

McTaggart's Argument

Two series. McTaggart distinguishes between the A-series (past, present, future) and the B-series (earlier/later than).

Why A-series matters. Without past/present/future, he argues, there is no genuine change. "Earlier than/later than" alone (the B-series) gives order, but not passage.

The contradiction. But the A-series is contradictory. Each event must be future, then present, then past. These are incompatible properties. To avoid contradiction, one might say an event is future at one time, present at another, past at another—but that already presupposes time, which makes the analysis circular.

The conclusion. Since time requires the A-series, and the A-series is contradictory, time is unreal.

The Counter-Argument

The unchanging order. It is true that the B-series order of events never changes. But the order of events is not itself an event in time; it is the structure of time. The fact that lightning precedes thunder is not "in" time; only the lightning and thunder are.

Why McTaggart's inference is spurious. From "the order of events never changes" it does not follow that "there is no change." What is in time (lightning, thunder, etc.) changes; what is not in time (the relation between them) does not.

Generation of the series. The B-series is generated by change: when A occurs, B is not yet occurring; when B occurs, C is not yet occurring. Change produces succession, and succession produces the B-series. Its unchanging order is the outcome of the generative process, not evidence of stasis.

The role of "now." "Now" is simply the boundary between what has been generated and what has not yet been generated. When A is occurring, A is "now"; when B occurs, B is "now."

Collapse of McTaggart's contradiction. Once we see that the B-series both presupposes and requires change, there is no problem in saying that an event was future, is now present, and will be past. These are not contradictory properties but successive relations to the generative "now."

Position in the Literature

McTaggart's 1908 article launched one of the most enduring debates in metaphysics. Since then, positions have polarized into two camps:

A-theorists (e.g. Prior, Zimmerman, Lowe) hold that genuine tense—past, present, and future—is metaphysically indispensable, and so they seek to repair the A-series against McTaggart's charge of contradiction.

B-theorists (e.g. Smart, Mellor, Oaklander) argue that the B-series suffices for time; passage and tense are either reducible or illusory.

Both sides have tended to accept McTaggart's core premise: that the B-series, considered by itself, does not contain change. The A-theorist uses this to argue for an irreducible A-series; the B-theorist uses it to explain away change as projection or illusion.

My argument rejects this shared assumption. The B-series not only permits change, it is generated by change. Its fixity as an ordering of events does not preclude passage; it is the product of passage. In this respect, my account diverges both from A-theorists (who think the B-series is insufficient) and from B-theorists (who think the B-series depicts a block universe devoid of real becoming). The "now" is not a mystical A-property nor an illusion, but simply the point of continuation in the generative process.

This repositioning also clarifies why the "indexical fallacy" debate has been a sideshow. Critics such as Gale and Mellor have said McTaggart confused indexicals with absolute properties, while Dummett rightly denied that charge. But all sides in that skirmish assume that the B-series by itself is changeless. It is that assumption, not any linguistic confusion, that fatally undermines McTaggart's reasoning.

On the Indexical Objection (and Dummett)

A common objection is that McTaggart commits an "indexical fallacy"—confusing indexical terms like "now," "past," and "future" (which shift with context) with absolute properties. This objection is weak. McTaggart does not make that mistake. His argument is not a trivial linguistic muddle, but a substantive metaphysical claim: he thinks an A-series is required for real change, and that such a series is incoherent.

Michael Dummett rightly defended McTaggart on this narrow point: the argument does not hinge on an indexical fallacy. But Dummett's defense is irrelevant to the real issue. The real flaw is McTaggart's assumption that because the B-series is unchanging, it therefore excludes change. That assumption is false. The B-series is not opposed to change; it is generated by change. Once this is seen, McTaggart's entire proof collapses.

Conclusion

McTaggart's "proof" of the unreality of time rests on a spurious inference: from the unchangeability of temporal order he infers the unreality of change. But temporal relations are not themselves in time; they are the structure by which events in time are ordered. The B-series does not preclude change but presupposes and requires it. The indexical charge against McTaggart is a distraction, and Dummett's defense of him on that point, though correct, is philosophically irrelevant.
