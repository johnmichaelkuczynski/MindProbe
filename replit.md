# Overview

Mind Reader is a cognitive/psychological/psychopathological profiler application that provides six distinct analysis types: cognitive, comprehensive cognitive, psychological, comprehensive psychological, psychopathological, and comprehensive psychopathological. The application functions as a passthrough system that relays user input to LLM services and returns unfiltered responses for professional assessment purposes.

## Recent Changes

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript using Vite as the build tool
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state, React hooks for local state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Real-time Communication**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) for streaming analysis results

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with local strategy (username/password), session-based with PostgreSQL store
- **Payment Processing**: Stripe integration with PaymentIntents API
- **File Processing**: Multer for file uploads with support for PDF, Word, and text files
- **Analysis Engine**: Custom service that processes questions in batches of 5 to avoid token limits
- **Storage**: Database-backed storage with user accounts, credit purchases, and analysis history

## Core Services
- **LLM Service**: Abstraction layer supporting multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Perplexity) referenced as ZHI 1-4
- **File Processor**: Handles text extraction from uploaded documents using pdf-parse and mammoth libraries
- **Analysis Engine**: Manages question sets and coordinates streaming responses for real-time feedback

## Data Flow Design
- **Input Processing**: Supports both text input and file uploads with validation
- **Batch Processing**: Questions sent to LLMs in groups of 5 with 10-second delays between batches
- **Real-time Streaming**: Responses displayed immediately as they arrive via SSE
- **Dialogue System**: Post-analysis conversation capability with regeneration options based on user feedback

## Security and Validation
- **Authentication**: Scrypt password hashing, session-based authentication with secure cookie settings
- **Payment Security**: Stripe webhook signature verification, payment intent ownership validation
- **Idempotency Protection**: Unique constraint on payment intent IDs, conditional credit addition
- **File Upload Restrictions**: 10MB limit with MIME type and extension validation
- **Input Validation**: Zod schemas for all data structures
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user feedback mechanisms

## Payment System
- **Credit-based Model**: Users purchase credits to run analyses
- **Stripe Integration**: 
  - PaymentIntents API with automatic payment methods
  - Webhook endpoint for production (signature verified)
  - Verification endpoint for test/development environments (Stripe API retrieval)
  - Dual-path processing ensures credits are added even when webhooks fail
- **Idempotency**: Prevents duplicate crediting via unique database constraints and boolean return checks
- **User Experience**: Processing/success/failed/error states with clear feedback and retry options
